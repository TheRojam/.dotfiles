# personal dotfiles of therojam

Here you can find personal dotfiles with personal (merged) config of [therojam](https://github.com/TheRojam).  
Merged because my colleagues at [eccenca](https://github.com/eccenca) gave me many tips or had their dotfile also public and linked me to them ;)  

Some are crypted, because these file are not public. The encryption is done with `[git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)` - "the Transparent file encryption".  
If you like to use it yourself you can look here [INSTALL.md of git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/blob/master/INSTALL.md).  
But if your a  mac user - you can use homebrew with `brew install git-crypt`  
 -- similar on debian/ubuntu but with an older release.

Made with Love at night on  mac!
